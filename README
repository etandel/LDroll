LuaDroll is a dice roller that can make virtually any number of rolls of almost any type of die (999d87 is a valid roll); it can also perform simple post-processing (such as summming all rolls, getting the biggest roll etc.)

It is implemented on the awesome language Lua (version 5.1), so - of course - to install it you need Lua 5.1 (www.lua.org). Actually, you don't need to perform any sort of installation, since to run LuaDroll, you just do 'lua main.lua" in your terminal and let the Lua interpreter do its job.


The program has 3 files that must be on the same directory:
"main.lua" is where the main program is (which is minimal).
"droll.lua" is where all the function definitions are, which means it's where all the LuaDroll mojo dwells.
"utils.lua" is a small and simple file with some handy utility functions.
